suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code snippet relies on an external module `daily_challenge_25`, which is not included.  Therefore, it's impossible to assess its correctness without seeing the implementation of the `Deck` class.
- To properly evaluate the code, include the definition of the `Deck` class within the submission.
