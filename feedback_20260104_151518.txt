suggestions for improvement:
- This code only implements the 'ADD_TASK' functionality which was likely part of a previous exercise. It doesn't address the requirements of the current challenge: editing tasks and filtering tasks by completion status.
- The code lacks the 'EDIT_TASK' and 'FILTER_TASKS' functionalities and the use of `useRef` as described in the instructions.
- The UI elements for editing and filtering are missing.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code implements the task filtering functionality as requested in the instructions.
- It relies on TaskItem component for editing. It's good to review that code as well
- Consider adding error handling or validation for dispatch actions to improve robustness.
- The filtering logic could be encapsulated into a separate helper function for better readability.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code only sets up the basic structure of the app and imports the TaskInput and TaskList components. It does not implement any of the requested features: editing tasks, filtering tasks, using `useRef` for editing, or implementing actions in the reducer for editing and filtering.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code only sets up the React application and TaskProvider. It does not implement the task editing or filtering features as requested in the problem description.
- The code should include the implementation of task editing using useRef, actions in the reducer for editing tasks, and filter tasks by completion status with buttons.
