suggestions for improvement:
- Separate the CSS into an external file (style.css) for better organization and maintainability.
- Consider adding error handling within the `addChar` function in case the data received from the API is incomplete or malformed.
- Move the event listener setup outside the script tag to ensure it's properly attached after the DOM is fully loaded.

suggestions for improvement:
