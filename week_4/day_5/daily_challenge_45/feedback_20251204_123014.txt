suggestions for improvement:
- The switchCurrencies function duplicates a lot of code from convertCurrencies. Consider refactoring to avoid duplication.
- The logic inside the switchButton event listener can be simplified.  The result of `convertCurrencies()` is a Promise, and its resolved value is not being checked; so the condition `if (convertCurrencies())` will not work as intended. The button should always switch the currencies, and then re-run the conversion.

suggestions for improvement:
- The API key is exposed in the client-side code. While this is for a demo, it's best practice to handle API keys securely (e.g., using environment variables on a backend server).
- Consider adding error handling to the `convertCurrencies` function to handle potential API errors or invalid responses more gracefully.  Displaying user-friendly error messages in the UI improves user experience.
- The switch currencies functionality could be improved for a better user experience. Currently, it only works if `convertCurrencies()` returns a truthy value. Consider saving the values of the 'from' and 'to' currencies in variables and swapping them directly, then calling `convertCurrencies()` with the new values.  This would make the switch functionality more robust.
- Duplicated code in `convertCurrencies` and `switchCurrencies`. Create a common function for fetching and displaying the converted value, and call it from both event listeners.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code is CSS styling. It needs to include JavaScript code to use Fetch API and async/await to interact with the exchangerate-api to build the currencies converter application.
- The code is missing the core logic for fetching currency options and conversion rates from the API as described in the instructions.
- The JavaScript part to create the currencies converter: HTML elements, event listeners, Fetch API calls, and async/await handling is totally missing.
