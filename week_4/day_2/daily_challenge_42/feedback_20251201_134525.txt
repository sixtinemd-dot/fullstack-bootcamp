suggestions for improvement:
- The HTML provides the form structure, but the crucial JavaScript functionality for retrieving data, converting it to JSON, and appending it to the DOM is missing. The javascript file 'daily_challenge.js' needs to be implemented to satisfy the requirements.
- The form's submit behavior needs to be handled in the javascript file, preventing the default form submission.
