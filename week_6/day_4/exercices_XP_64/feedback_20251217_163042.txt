suggestions for improvement:
- This code snippet only contains the export statement for Exercise 2. It needs the corresponding app.js file to be complete.
- Consider providing the app.js file to showcase the import and usage of the exported data.

suggestions for improvement:
- The callbacks in `readFileSync` and `writeFileSync` are not necessary since they don't handle errors, and `readFileSync` is synchronous, so no callback is needed.
- Error handling should be implemented to catch potential exceptions during file operations.
- Consider using asynchronous versions of `readFile` and `writeFile` (`fs.readFile` and `fs.writeFile`) for better performance in non-blocking I/O operations, especially in a server environment.

suggestions for improvement:
- The response provides code without the necessary context (e.g., the content of `math.js`). Therefore, the correctness of the response cannot be evaluated.
- The file paths are assumed. To properly assess, include the 'math.js' file's content.

URL: https://github.com/sixtinemd-dot/fullstack-bootcamp/blob/main/week_6/day_4/exercices_XP_64/mathApp/package.json
suggestions for improvement:
- The submitted code is a `package.json` file, which describes a Node.js project. While this is related to the exercise instructions for Exercise 5, it doesn't implement the core requirements of creating a `math.js` module with addition and multiplication functions or `app.js` to use these functions and lodash. The file only initializes a Node.js project and installs the lodash package.
- To complete the exercise, you need to create `math.js` and `app.js` with the functions and logic as described in the problem description.

suggestions for improvement:
- This JSON describes an NPM package, but it doesn't contain any code related to the exercise instructions.
- The exercise instructions require creating and running a javascript file (app.js) that utilizes the chalk package to print colored text to the terminal. This submission does not include this file.

suggestions for improvement:
- The `todo.js` file, which should contain the `TodoList` class definition, is missing. Therefore, the code cannot be executed.
- The instructions mention creating a directory named `todoApp` and placing `todo.js` and `app.js` inside it, but the provided code does not reflect this directory structure.
- The code only demonstrates the usage of the `TodoList` class but does not provide its definition, making it incomplete.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code only contains the `TodoList` class definition, but the exercise also requires creating `app.js` to import and use this class.
- The implementation could benefit from better error handling, e.g., handling cases where a task to be completed doesn't exist.
