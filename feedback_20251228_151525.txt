suggestions for improvement:
- The ErrorBoundary component should set the `error` property in the state to `null` initially, and update it in `componentDidCatch`.
- The error value is set to `null` as requested, but it's never used.
- The state should contain both `error` and `errorInfo` properties, as used in the render method. Currently, it only contains `hasError`.
- The logic for checking the error state in the `render` method should use `this.state.hasError` instead of `this.state.errorInfo` to determine whether to display the fallback UI.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider extracting the `Child` component to its own file for better organization, especially in larger projects.
- While the `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate` method is correctly implemented, ensure it is used to capture some information and use in `componentDidUpdate` if the functionality required it. Currently it is just logging to the console
- Add more comments to the code to explain the purpose of each section, making it easier for others to understand.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider creating separate components for each simulation in Exercise 1 to improve code organization.
- While the code functions, adding comments explaining the purpose of each section (Simulation 1, 2, 3) would increase readability.
- In the `handleClick` function of `BuggyCounter`, destructuring `counter` from the previous state is not strictly necessary, but good practice. Ensure consistency throughout the project.
- Ensure that the FavoriteColor component implements the lifecycle methods as described in Exercise 2.
