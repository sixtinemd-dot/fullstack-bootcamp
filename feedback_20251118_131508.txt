suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, the `print(c1 + 5)` and `print(c1 + c3)` lines were commented out.  Uncomment these lines to test the addition of an integer and the `TypeError` exception.
- Exercise 2 is not implemented. Create the `func.py` file and `exercise_one.py` files as instructed, and demonstrate the import and function call.
- In Exercise 5, it calculates the time until January 1st of 2026, should calculate until next year (the next January 1st).
- Consider using more descriptive variable names to improve readability.
