suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding type annotations to the parameters and return values of the methods for improved readability.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding error handling for edge cases, such as an empty library when calling `listBooks` or `getBookDetails`.
- The getBookDetails method could return a `Book` object or null instead of a string. This would give the caller more flexibility.
- Consider adding some comments to explain complex logic.
