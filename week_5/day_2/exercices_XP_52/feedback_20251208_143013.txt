suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, the properties `name` and `salary` should be declared as `private`, and `department` as `protected`. Also, the method name is misspelled (`getEmplyeeInfo`).
- In Exercise 1, the constructor parameters' names are different from the class properties' names. It would improve readability if you use the same names.
- In Exercise 2, the code includes a commented-out line that attempts to modify the `readonly` property `id`. This is good for demonstrating the intended behavior, but a brief comment explaining why it's commented out would be helpful.
- In Exercise 3, the base `Animal` class's `makeSound` method takes a sound parameter that is not used when overridden in the derived class.  It is misleading to have this parameter.
- In Exercise 5, the function `printUserDetails` incorrectly uses `User.name` instead of `User.email` when printing the email. This should be corrected.
- Consider adding type annotations in function parameters and return types for better code clarity and maintainability.
