suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 4, the increase of Dan's rent should be an assignment '=', not an addition '+=', based on the instructions. 
- In Exercise 1, using `lastIndexOf` to get the last element is not the correct usage. `lastIndexOf` is for finding the last occurrence of a specific element.  The correct approach would be `people[people.length - 1]`.
