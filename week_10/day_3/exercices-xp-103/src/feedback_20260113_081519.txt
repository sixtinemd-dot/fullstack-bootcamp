suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code only renders a BookList component inside the App component, but it does not implement any Redux logic as outlined in the exercise description. The exercise specifically asks to set up a Redux store, define an initial state for books, create selectors using `createSelector`, and implement UI interactions to demonstrate selector functionality.
- The BookList component is not provided, so it is impossible to assess if it implements the selector logic.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using a `useMemo` hook to memoize the `books` variable to prevent unnecessary re-renders when the component re-renders for reasons other than a change in genre or books.
- For larger applications, using constants for genre strings can improve maintainability.

suggestions for improvement:
- Implement selectors using `createSelector` from `@reduxjs/toolkit` to filter books by genre.
- Create React components to display the book lists and handle genre selection.
- Connect the React components to the Redux store using `useSelector` and `useDispatch` from `react-redux`.

suggestions for improvement:
- The code only sets up the Redux store. It needs to include the bookSlice definition, initial state, selectors, and component implementation as described in the instructions.
- The code lacks the initial state with an array of books and the `createSelector` implementation for filtering books based on genres.
- The React component implementation is missing which is required to display book lists based on genres.
