suggestions for improvement:
- Consider extracting the input elements into a separate component for better organization and reusability.
- The book id generation is simplistic. In a real application, you might want to use a more robust method for generating unique IDs, such as UUIDs.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code only implements the generic `List` component. The instructions also require implementing the `Book` type, the `BookApp` component with the useState hook, and the `addBook` functionality. The solution is incomplete.
- Consider adding the Book type definition, the BookApp component with useState for managing the book list, and the addBook function to fully address the problem.
