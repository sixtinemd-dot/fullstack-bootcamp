suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code appears to be CSS styling, but the instructions call for building a React Carousel using the `react-responsive-carousel` package.
- The provided CSS styling does not contain React components or JSX syntax, and does not address the core requirements of building a carousel using the specified package.
- The task description requests the use of specific image URLs. This styling doesn't implement that.
