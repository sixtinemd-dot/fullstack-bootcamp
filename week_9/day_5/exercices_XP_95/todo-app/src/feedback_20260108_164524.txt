suggestions for improvement:
- The code only implements the 'addTodo' functionality and omits the 'toggle' and 'remove' functionalities, which are explicitly mentioned in the instructions.
- While the component is connected to Redux, the implementation only covers adding a todo. The instructions mention the need to map state properties and action dispatchers, but this component only deals with dispatching the 'addTodo' action.
- The structure for handling actions/reducers/store is not provided in the code. Without it, it is difficult to assess the entire correctness of the submission.

suggestions for improvement:
- The code covers displaying todos, toggling completion, and removing todos as required by the exercise instructions. However, it omits the crucial functionality of adding new todos. This is a significant omission.
- While `mapStateToProps` is correctly implemented, the action creators are directly passed to `connect`. It's better practice to explicitly define `mapDispatchToProps` for clarity and potential future modifications.
- Consider using more descriptive variable names within the component for better readability. For instance, instead of just 'todo', use 'currentTodo' or 'item'.
- Add prop types to the component to improve code maintainability.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding more descriptive comments to enhance readability, especially for complex logic within components or Redux-related files.
- Optimize component rendering by using memoization techniques like React.memo or shouldComponentUpdate, especially if the todo list grows larger.
- Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent potential security vulnerabilities, such as XSS attacks, if user input is rendered directly.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using `immer` library to simplify immutable state updates, although the current implementation is correct.
- For larger applications, using a more robust ID generation strategy (like UUIDs) might be preferable to avoid potential ID collisions, although the current approach is sufficient for the given exercise.

suggestions for improvement:
- You should include the definitions of actions (action types and action creators).
- You should include the definition of the reducer (todoReducer).
- Implement the React components as described in the instructions.
- Connect the React components to the Redux store using `connect` from `react-redux`.
