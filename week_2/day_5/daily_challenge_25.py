""" Exercise 1: Quizz
Answer the following questions: """

# What is a class?
  # A class is a blueprint used to create objects
# What is an instance?
  # An instance is an object created from a class
# What is encapsulation?
  # Encapsulation means grouping attributes and methods together inside a class
# What is abstraction?
  # Abstraction means showing only what is necessary and hiding details
# What is inheritance?
  # Inheritance allows a class to receive attributes and methods from another class
# What is multiple inheritance?
  # Multiple inheritance means a class can inherit from more than one parent class
# What is polymorphism?
  # Polymorphims allows different classes to have methods with the same name, but different behavior
# What is method resolution order or MRO?
  # MRO is the order in which Python looks for a method or attribute when you call it

""" Exercise 2: Create a deck of cards class
The Deck of cards class should NOT inherit from a Card class.

The requirements are as follows:

The Card class should have a suit (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades) and a value (A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K)
The Deck class :
should have a shuffle method which makes sure the deck of cards has all 52 cards and then rearranges them randomly.
should have a method called deal which deals a single card from the deck. After a card is dealt, it should be removed from the deck. """
