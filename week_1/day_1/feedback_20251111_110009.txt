suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using more descriptive variable names to enhance readability (e.g., user_age instead of age).
- Add input validation where appropriate (e.g., ensure the user enters a number in the 'Odd or Even' exercise).
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately addresses all exercises, correctly implementing print statements, variables, mathematical operations, comparison operators, if statements, and user input as described in the chapter content. All exercises produce the expected results.
- readability: The code is generally well-structured and easy to follow. The inclusion of comments before each exercise and code block enhances readability. However, some variable names could be more descriptive.
- performance: The code's performance is efficient and appropriate for the exercises' scope. There are no performance bottlenecks.
- security: The code is secure, as it does not involve any external resources or sensitive operations that could lead to vulnerabilities. Input validation is minimal but adequate for these exercises.
