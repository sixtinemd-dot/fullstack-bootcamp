suggestions for improvement:
- The HTML structure provided is correct, but there's no JavaScript code to assess.  The instructions specifically require JavaScript to manipulate the DOM elements.
- To fulfill the requirements, you need to add a JavaScript file (exercice5.js) and link it to the HTML.  Within this file, you must implement the DOM manipulation steps outlined in Exercise 5.

suggestions for improvement:
- Small typo in 'attedance', should be 'attendance'.
- The problem specified the last <li> of the *second* ul should be set to none and it seems to do that with the *first* ul instead.

suggestions for improvement:
- The HTML file only sets up the basic structure and links to a JavaScript file, but it doesn't contain any code that directly addresses any of the exercises described in the Chapter Content/Questions. Therefore, it doesn't implement any of the required functionality.
- The provided HTML is only a shell. The Javascript file (exercices_XP.js) which is not present here should contain the solution to the exercises.

suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, the requirement was to console.log each number individually, rather than pushing them into an array and then logging the array. You can improve Exercise 4 by implementing the bonus to use one prompt instead of three separate prompts.
- In Exercise 7, while displaying the book details, you are not including the image tag. Also, the image url is taken directly from google search results, it should be a direct link to a hosted image for a more stable implementation.
- The code in myBill() in Ex2 calculates the itemPrice incorrectly `let itemPrice = stock[item] * prices[item]` should be `let itemPrice = prices[item]`
