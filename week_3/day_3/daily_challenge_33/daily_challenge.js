// Daily challenge: Tell the story

// Instructions
// In todays exercise we will be creating a Mad Libs game.
// If you’ve never played this game, a mad lib is a game where you fill in a bunch of blank inputs with different word types (ie : noun, adjective, verb), and then a story is generated based on the words you chose, and sometimes the story is surprisingly funny.

// Follow these steps :

// Get the value of each of the inputs in the HTML file when the form is submitted. Remember the event.preventDefault()
// Make sure the values are not empty
// Write a story that uses each of the values.
// Make sure you check the console for errors when playing the game.
