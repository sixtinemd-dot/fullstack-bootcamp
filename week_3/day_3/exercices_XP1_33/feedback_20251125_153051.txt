suggestions for improvement:
- The response contains only the HTML structure, but it lacks the JavaScript code required to fulfill the instructions in Exercise 1. Therefore, the provided HTML alone does not solve any of the problems stated in the exercise.
- The JavaScript part is missing, the HTML file only provides the initial structure and the button element. There is no functionality implemented to manipulate the DOM, handle events, or modify the styles as requested in the exercise.

suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, the bonus sections are not implemented (hover on h1 to change font size randomly and hover on 2nd paragraph to fade out).
- In Exercise 1, the button to make all paragraphs bold requires corresponding HTML to be fully functional. While the JS is correctly implemented, there's no button element with id 'makeBold' provided in the initial HTML snippet.

suggestions for improvement:
- The HTML file is incomplete; it needs the content from Exercise 1, 3, and 4 to be able to check if javascript code added in the external file 'exercice2_XP1.js' is solving the exercises correctly.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using more descriptive variable names for the elements retrieved by their `name` attribute, e.g., `firstNameInput` and `lastNameInput` instead of `inputOne` and `inputTwo`.
- For consistency, you could use `const` for all the input elements since they are not being reassigned.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code only contains the HTML structure and a link to a JavaScript file. It does not include any JavaScript code to solve the exercise's requirements. A JavaScript file with the logic needs to be included to address the DOM manipulation, event handling, and styling changes specified in the exercise.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code snippet only includes the HTML structure for Exercise 4. The JavaScript logic, which is the core requirement of the exercise (calculating the volume of a sphere and handling form submission), is missing. Ensure the Javascript is implemented in the linked js file.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding input validation to ensure the radius is a number.
- Use `parseFloat` on the radius input value to ensure it's treated as a number.
- Add error handling in case the input is invalid.
