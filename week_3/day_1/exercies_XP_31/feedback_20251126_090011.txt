suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, using `shift()` instead of `splice(0, 1)` to remove the first element could be slightly more readable.
- In Exercise 4, instead of hardcoding '1200' as the new rent, calculate the increase dynamically for better maintainability.

suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 4, the requirement was to *increase* Dan's rent *to* 1200. The code currently *increases* Dan's rent *by* 1200.
- In Exercise 1, `lastIndexOf` is not appropriate in finding the last name. Instead of using `people.lastIndexOf("Sixtine")`, use `people[people.length - 1]`
- Bonus for Exercise 2 was not attempted.
